Welcome to the Entharlium Mod.

This mod features new items and new gear to be made out of the items:

	- Entharlium Ore generate across the world (very rare).
	- Entharlium Gems for crafting (beauty in your hands).
	- Entharlium Mix made out of Diamond and Emerald, smelt it to make Entharlium Gem (comes in handy).
	- Full set of Entharlium armor (bright, orange, and unstoppable!).
		- Entharlium Helmet
		- Entharlium Chestplate
		- Entharlium Leggings
		- Entharlium Boots
	- Full set of Entharlium tools (useful!).
		- Entharlium Sword
		- Entharlium Pickaxe
		- Entharlium Shovel
		- Entharlium Axe
		- Entharlium Hoe

And most important, the Teleporter Block.
Using different items (Entharlium Gem, Diamond, Emerald, Gold, and Iron), give your teleporter power to teleport you away!
The different items give your teleporter different power:
	- Entharlium Gem: 100 power
	- Diamond: 25 power
	- Emerald: 25 power
	- Gold ingot: 5 power
	- Iron ingot: 4 power
Then, just right click the block with a "Teleport Wand" and whoosh away to another teleporter block!
Want to chose which block to teleport to? No worries! You can set an "id" to each teleporter and make sure that you teleport to the block that you want to.
To do this, hold a normal stick in your hand, or offhand, and rightclick the teleporter block to raise and lower the id value, respectively.

Have fun teleporting!
